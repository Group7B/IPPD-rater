### Setup
In order to setup this repository, first clone the project then run

```bash
$ npm install
```

(assuming you already set everything up for previous projects).  You will need a local.js file that is NOT included in this public repository for privacy reasons (passwords and whatnot), so hit me (Amanda) up for that.  Once you get it, please squeeze it into config/env.

Once you have done this, simply run

```bash
$ grunt
```

then open a browser and go to "localhost/3000" (or if you're still using IE or Edge, then "http://localhost/3000") and you should see the default (or not) webpage.
